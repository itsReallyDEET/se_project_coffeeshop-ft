# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the fulltime Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

I would like to add more animation to the project. A smoother transition from one section of the page to next instead of snapping which can also hint to users that they're navigating the same webpage instead of different pages on a website. This can help prevent confusion amongst users who may use the back button on their browser, taking them away from the website.
